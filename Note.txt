Login Functionality.

first we will call the login mutation from userApiSlice that will send a request to the backend and set the cookie.

then we wwill call from the authslice setCredentials and then get the user stored the localstorage not the token.

we will also use a package called react-toastify in your frontend that will give a message to the user if wrong credentials are inputed. 

so lets get started by installing toastify  by running npm i react-toastify
to use react-toastify we will go to our main app component i.e App.js and import toastContainer from react-toastify then we also import the css file. Then we put ToastContainer in our app component.

Then in login screen we worked on the functionality of our login, we imported lots of components which we used. 
after which we tried login in upon successful we will be redirected.

Then we worked on making our sign in link in header.jsx dynamic so that when someone successfully signed in the name of the user will be displayed, we also added a drop-down nav for the user...containing profile page link and logout link.
