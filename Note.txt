Adding the Cart Screen 

when you add an item to the cart it takes you to the cart page.
we go the screen folder and add a cartScreen componenent. 
To  navigate we imported useNavigate.
To get a state from global state we imported useSelector.
To dispatch our useSelecttor state we imported useDispatch.

After writing our CartScreen functions 
we were able to get our item into the cartscreen, were able to integrate quantity increment and decrement directly from the cartScreen,
we were able to calculate the sum total price of the items dynamically 
and added a proceed tp checkout button.

then we export the cartScreen and were able to use it in index.js.
