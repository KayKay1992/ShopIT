User Logout!

functionality to log out
two things that need to happen when we log out 
we need to have a logout endpoint in users api slice to hit the users_url/logout thats how we destroy the cookie on the server backend.
we also need to logout on the authslice that will take care of the local storage.

so in users api slice we added a logout mutattion where we accesed our url through the query function. then we export the logout mutation.
then in authSlice we added logout function which is going to take in state and action, this is where we remove the userInfo from local storage.

then we have to implement both the logout in the authslice and the one in userapislice in the header because thats where our logout link is.

Action logout a user then check in application to check if the cookie is empty in httponly and check also on localstorage to see if you will find a user.
