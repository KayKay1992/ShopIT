JSON WEB TOKEN 
How json web token work: 
we have several ways of authentication in web developement using cookies, sessions, Jsonwebtoken or combinations and others ..in this case we will use the Jsonwebtoken.
json web token is a secured way of sharing information between the server and the client.
it consist of 3 parts a header, a payload and a signature. the payload is the constains information like the user id .
we use jwt to verify a user is authenticated. when a verified user is signed in, te user gets a token which gets stored in the google storage of the client and then send that token to any protected route. But this process is not secured because anybody can access the token from mthe browser. 
so we will generate a jwt token and then store it in hhtp only cookie on the server. so we will create a middleware for this. this will make the token not to stored in the browser
