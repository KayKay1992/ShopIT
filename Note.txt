Backend setup, express server and initial Product route;
we ran npm init in the root folder to set up our package.json.
in package.json to enable us use import in backend just like the way we used in frontend instead of using required we set the type to module.
in package.json we change the test script to start and thats where we run our backend server with npm start.
then we install express dependencies in our root folder with npm install express
then we import the express package in the server.js file.
then we created a variable for port which we set to be 5000
then we created a variable called app to initialize express.
then we created our first route with get request.
then we use app.listen to start and listen to our server
We then added route for single product and route for all products. after we moved products file to data folder.
always restart the application each time you made changes otherwise install and setup nodemon
