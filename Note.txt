Creating Products

we will be able to create a new product we will start from backend first. 
we created a new endpoint in productController to create a new product. then we save it and export.

then we create a route in the product route.
>then we go to ptoduct api slice and create a mutation called createProduct and export it.
> then we go to product list screen and bring in our useCreateProductMutation 

If you are unable to create a new product product when you click on create Product button try to log out and log in again as admin.
