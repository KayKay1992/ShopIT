    ITEM COUNT IN THE HEADER

Now we want to show the number of items we have in the cart logo at the header section.
we are going to learn how to select anything you want from the global state. We are going to do it using a react hook called useSelector.
so we go to our header component and import useSelector from react-redux.
we go to our component and distructure what you want, the useSelector holds a function which holds the state, you use the state to select what you want, this time is cart. so we did state.cart
then in the cart navlink we display the total quantity of our cartitems in the cart. we imported badge from react-bootstrap.
