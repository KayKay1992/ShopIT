Auth user and get token
User Email and Password Validation

* we have to use req.body to request for the body of data.
* We have to add middleware in server.js to enable us use the middleware to parse our body i.e use of body parser. 

*So in server.js we added body parser middleware.
we also added the urlencoded where we parse in an object with extended keyword and set it to true.

in conroller we destructure the email and password from the request body. 

then we check for the user if the user that has that email and password

we hashed the password in our userModel and checked for matched password in our controller auth.
