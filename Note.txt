Multer and image upload endpoint for backend.
we are able to edit a product now, but still unable to upload image, now we want to work on that we want to use a package called multer.
so install multer in the root directory by running npm i multer
then we go into our backend and create a new route file called uploadRoute.js. create a folder at the root directory called upload. this is where everything uploaded in our site will save.
after creating our uploadRoute we will go to server.js and bring in our upload route and use it.
Then we need to make our upload file static, for this we need to import path from path at the op of server.js file.
