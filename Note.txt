Pay and Deliver Order Status Updated to paid and delievered

Now we want the admin to be able to mark the order as delivered. 
> We will go to orderController and write function for updateOrdertoDelivered function we already have one for updateOrderToPaid. 
> Then we go to orderApislice and add mutations for deliverorder and payorder which we exported.
> then we use this mutations in OrderdetailsScreen to update the order to paid and delivered.
