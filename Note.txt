    ADMIN ROUTE COMPONENTS

    this component will only allow an admin to have access to some pages.
    then we created an adminRoute component in frontend src.  the first admin screen we created is orderlist screen.
    we imported adminRoute to index.jsx.
    for admin dropdown we go to the header.jsx and add it.
