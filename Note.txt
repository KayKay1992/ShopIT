Adding Add to the cart functionality.
we will add the reducer action to add the item to the cart.
so we go to the cartSlice and to the reducer object and add a new function called add to the cart,
in add to cart since its areducer action is going to take 2 things state and action. 
so we calculated the items price, shipping price, tax price and the total price and save it to the localstorage.
then we exported the addToCart  function to enable us use it in our components.
