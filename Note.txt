preparing for deployment
we are not going to have our react dev server in production.
so we go to server.js to check if the process.env.node_env === 'production' 

in root package.json we created a script called build. so that when we run npm run build from root it can acually run.

when you run npm run build it will create an optimized production build ... so in your terminal run npm run build.
after you will see a build folder created in your frontend.

in your .env set the NODE_ENV = "production"

After changed the NODE_ENV = "development" and delete the build folder because render its going to create it automatically.
