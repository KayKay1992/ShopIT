Creating Order and setting the ui
we created the ui of the placeOrder screen 
we displayed the step using the checkoutSteps functionality.

Then we get the shipping address, payment method and Order items and order summary and a button that handles the placeOrder.
upon successful placing order this buton upon click takes us to order id route.
