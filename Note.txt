USER PROFILE AND UPDATE 

WE WANT TO LIST ON OUR PROFILE ALL THE ORDERS WEVE MADE:

First we will update our user profile.
we startup from userApiSlice where we will add a mutation to update a profile then we export useProfileMutation where we use it in our profile screen. we created Profilescreen.jsx
so we add the profile screen at the index.jsx route file.

secondly we want to show our orders.
we will find all the users orders and return them. 
in ordersApiSlice we will add the getMyorders querry. then we export it and use it in our profile screen
