User Routes and COntroller.

Now we will just have a structure for our route and controller first we will add the functionality later.
in route folder we created userRoute.js and in controller folder we will add the userController.js
the controller holds the function while the route holds the user Routes. 

Then we pass the userRoute to the server.js
