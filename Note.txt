Creating API Slice and start Order Screen

We first craeted ordersApiSLice in slice folder where we craeted an action creator and create the createOrder mutation which we exported.

then in cartSlice we added a function to claar cart items when we successfuly craete an order. this function will wipe all the items in our cart.

then we added a place order screen which we exported and used in index.js in the private route.
