GETTING PRODUCTS FROM DATABASE.

Now we wanna fetch our product from database.
in serverjs is where we have our product route, the file will get stacked when u jamppered all the your route in serverjs.
so we need the separate the route in separate file.So in backend we created a route folder and created a productRoute file which holds all the product routes, we then export this component to our server.js. 

Then to be able to handle the errors properly we have to use async and await function so we created a middleware folder which hold our asyncHandler function file.
we use the asyncHandler function to wrap our callback function routes.
to fetch product from our database we have to import our productModel to our productRoute file. Then we use the find method with empty object string to find all the product while we use findById to find a particular product.

then we test the get single product route in the postman.
