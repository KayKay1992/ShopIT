Preparing Sample Data.

we will move a sample data to the database to enable us fetch it with a user. this is called database seeder.
we will prepare sample data and create a seed, which will be scriptify which will import our product with users when we run our application.

we removed the ids in producct.js because database is going to generate an id for us. we will have a user connected to our product.js file but we will do that in seedScript.
we created another file in data folder called user.js.
we installed a package call bcryptjs in root folder we will use it to hash our password.
