Frontend End Authentication.
Auth slice and user API Slice.
in this slice we will save the users credential to the localstorage.
we created an authSilce.js file in slice folder, 
in this file we created our authslice for user info.
then we added this authslice to the store file.  importing the authslicereucer.

then we created userApiSlice we used the apilice to inject a new endpoint login which is a mutation not a query. though we used query to get the url

when you inspect your browser, in redux you will see the auth object which holds the user info for now it is null.
