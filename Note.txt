Upload Product Image Frontend

in productAPISLICE we added a mutation of upload product image where we query the data and specify the uploadurl. we added the the uploadurl in the constants file.
then we use it in product edit screen. 
where we were able to render our image upload successfully.

we fixed a little bug in server.js and added a link to our logo in header.jsx component.
