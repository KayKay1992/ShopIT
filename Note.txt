Paginate component: And paginating our admin pages userlist and productlist.
we created a paginating component, and use it to paginate our admin pages. the userslist and productlist.
in productcontroller we wrote the backend function for paginating productlist we did same too for userslist. 
in index.js we created and registered the route for pagination of productlist using the pagenumber and did thesame for userlist too.

inusersApiSlice, at getUsers query we write the query for getting all users using pagenumber this is for pagination. as we did in getting and paginating the productlist.

in both userslistScreen and productlistScreen we use the paginating component which we created to display our paginating function importing useparams and using it to register our pageNumber.
