LOGOUT USER AND CLEAR COOKIES.

we will  find way to clear cookies that is log out a user without we coming to postman for deleting the cookie

In user controller at logout function we set res.cookie to empy string, i contains also the jwt and an object where we set the expires.

in postman sign in a user then log out the user you will see the cookie will be gone.
