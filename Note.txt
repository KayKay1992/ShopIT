NODEMON AND CONCURRENTLY

We install nodemon so that we dont have to resatrt our application every time, also we install concurrently to enable us run backend and frontend same time despite having different port. with npm i -D nodemon concurrently.
so we setup some scriptts in package.json
server=== for running backend
client=== for running frontend
dev === for running the both server and client simultaneously
