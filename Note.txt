fetching Products.
We are going to use axios to fetch data. so we will install axios in our frontend using npm i axios.
in package.json we added proxy which helps us to fetch http domain instaed of repeating it everytime.
now we want to fetch the product from the backend.
we did this both in the homescreen fetching all products from backend product file even at productScreen using useState and useEffect hook, we fetched with axios. 

but next rather than fetching from dummy file in backed we want to fetch from database.
