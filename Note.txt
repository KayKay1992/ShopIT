JWT HTTP ONLY COOKIE:
install jsonwebton in your root folder with  this command npm i jsonwebtoken
Now we are going to use it in the userController file so we import jwt from the jsonwebton.
jwt.sign() is a function that creates the token, it holds an object of the payload which happens to be the user id, then the JWT_SECRET which we will store in .env, then expiredIn 

then we set jwt as http only cookie using res.cookie()
you can set your JWT_SECRET in .env as anything you want.
whenever you add anything in .env make sure you restart the server. 

After everyrhing you can sign in a user in the postman or any api testing tool you are using, upon successful login,     you will see a cookie for that user, you can then copy the token and open jwt.io in browser and paste that your token. you will see the structure.

Next is to create a middleware that will process our cookie which we will parse in our secured routes to make it private.
