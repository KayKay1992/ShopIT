Redux store and API slice

Move to your frontend folder and install a package with this command npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react_redux.
Create a file in your frontend folder called store.js.
Import configureStore from reduxjs/toolkit.
then we configureStore a store storing it in a store variable.
then we export the store as default.
Then we go to our index.js and surround routerProvider with react redux provider we first import react redux from provider.
we then created a constant file where we save our constant url routes.
Then we created our slices this are collection of reducers and action that are related to each other.
we can created multiple slices and each slice will have its own state.we will have root api slice, product, users and orders api slices. 
So in src folder we created a new folder callled slices, where we created apiSlice file.
Then we use our apislice in store.js to configure the reducer boiler plate.
