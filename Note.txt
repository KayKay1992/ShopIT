Edit Product.

Now after creating our product with sample data what we will do is now to edit it. so we are going to work on edit funtionality.
> in productController we created updateproduct functtion. this is the backened functionality that enables us to update an already created product.
> in productRoute we created Route to update a  product. 
> for front end, for slice at productApislice we created updateproduct mutation which we exported. 
> we created a productEditScreen where we use the updateProductmutation to update our product, after creating our editproduct screen we then register it in our frontend route that is in index.js.
